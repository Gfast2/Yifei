This project is inspired from the project "Makelangelo" from Dan Royer (marginallyclever.com) and the project "Der Kritzler" form Alex Weber (tinkerlog.com).

This is another drawbot. ~_~

It use two NEMA23 step motors and a step motor driver board (based on TB6560) bought from ebay and a servo (the pwm signal from microcontroller control the speed of the servo rather not the position). The Microcontroller board I used is a ChipKIT UNO32. And it is really fast enough to drive the motors and servo unbeliveable fast. 
Because of the structor, the faster the Gondola (Penholder) is moving, the stronger the motor should be.
