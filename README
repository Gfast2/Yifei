This project is inspired from the project "Makelangelo" from Dan Royer (marginallyclever.com) and the project "Der Kritzler" form Alex Weber (tinkerlog.com).

This is another drawbot. ~_~

It use two NEMA23 step motors and a step motor driver board (based on TB6560) bought from ebay and a servo (the pwm signal from microcontroller control the speed of the servo rather than the position). The Microcontroller board is a ChipKIT UNO32. And it is really fast enough to drive the motors and servo under a unbeliveable speed. 
Because of the structor, the faster the Gondola (Penholder) is moving, the stronger the motor should be. For this point I've done a small research and made a data visualization to explain it.
